# NutriLedger App

Description of the app :

1. I want to create a web app that can record income/expenses by category in daily life, including tracking food menus (dropdown) that the user eats, along with an estimate of the calories consumed from the food. The app should also summarize this data on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, showing what was eaten and what was spent on various categories.

2. I want to integrate the web app's API with AWS services.

3. When a user records data in the web app, the data will be saved to a database and the dashboard will be updated every time new data is entered.
